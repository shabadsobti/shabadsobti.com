description: Many insurers are functioning on outdated legacy technology stacks
  and neglected architecture. While some national insurance companies have
  followed the direct-to-consumer trend, many insurers haven’t begun modernizing
  or don’t know where to start. The longer they wait, the harder they’ve found
  it to support these legacy systems and attract and retain large market
  segments with higher product expectations. Insurtech startups who have fully
  embraced a personalized digital experience are taking advantage and rapidly
  acquiring market share.
