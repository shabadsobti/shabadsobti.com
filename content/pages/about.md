Hi! :rocket: <br>
I am Shabad Sobti. I grew up in New Delhi, India, and moved to Virginia when I was 17. I graduated in 2019 with a Bachelor's of Sciences in Computer Science from the University of Virginia. Currently, I am working as a Software Engineer at [Levvel](https://www.levvel.io/) in Charlote, North Carolina.

Nonetheless, these blogs talk about things that interest me and there are certainly some things to think about.
