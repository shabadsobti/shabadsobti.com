## ConnectMe

- Also known as TexMe
- HackUVA Winner

ConnectMe was a platform with a mission to increase internet accessibility across the globe and bring down the barriers that hold the west apart from the east. Providing easy access to information in these parts of the world is the first step in achieving this goal. Our first platform TexMe (MVP) leverages cellular network to connect people to the internet and give them access to information over voice call and text messages. The concept of TexMe was first thought of at HackUVa where it was awarded - The Best Mobile Hack Prize and the Freedom Prize. After that TexMe was awarded the University of Virginia Pike Expo Entrepreneurship Award. Although still young, we strived to make an impact each day. We aspired to be the paragon of equality, championing equal access to what has become a fundamental resource in the world - the internet.

## Third World Code

- HackUVA - Grand Prize Winner

Our team was comprised of Shabad (from India) and Juan (from Guatemala). Although we both had the privilege to pursue university in the US and study computer science, the majority of people in our countries barely have access to technology. Constantly bugged by this idea, we decided to channel our knowledge into a platform that would provide support for those who are interested in computer science but yet cannot afford a computer or even internet connectivity. However, it is predicted that by the end of 2019 around 70% of the world population will have a mobile device.

This drove us to develop the idea of Third World Code. A platform that facilitates learning the fundamentals of computer science without access to a computer or the internet. The idea is to reduce inequality in access to resources in computer science by providing middle-school teachers with SMS assisted coding exercises for their students. After the teacher selects a set of problems for his students to solve, our web server distributes the code via text message to the students. The students reply to the server with code stubs which are then compiled on the cloud. The server then gives feedback on the students exercises, as well as record each individual's performance.

## ImagineCode

It brings all the resources to a resource limited
classroom. Using our platform, a deskilled curriculum can be run by a facilitator, and reduce the
need for expert teachers. It is targeted specifically at developing nations, and aims to put the
learning into context in rural areas.

- **Introduction and Concepts** -
  The first module is an introduction module, where students learn how to use the platform, and the concepts needed for the further modules.
- **Guided Projects** -
  The platform walks the students through guided mini projects and teaches them how to apply their learnings from the conepts module.
- **Sandbox**
  This section allows the students to use the hardware kits and build projects of their own choice.
